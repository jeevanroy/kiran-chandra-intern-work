    #This an acceptable code that generates n number rectangles that do not overlap on each other.

    #This is an optimised version where we can optimise the space on the 1000x1000 page.

    #Removing the perfect_square() check and perfect_square_rect() functions and using only one function that contains the break_value variable
    and renaming that to generate_rectangles()

    #In the optimised one if we provide n=9 then a 3x3 grid will be generated and 9 rectangles will be generated.

    #But now for n=9 a 4x4 grid will be generated and 9 rectangles are drawn leaving the other 7.
    And for n=15 a 4x4 grid will be generated and 15 rectangles are drawn leaving the ONE.

    #Rectangles are drawn like the numbers in the numberpad on our keyboard.
    Ex: for n=9;
    row1:1st rectangle will be generated at number 1 block,then 2,then 3,then4 ,and then row2 starts filling with the 4th on top of 1st....

    #Here space on the page is not optimised.

    #for every n there will be a k that satisfies k**2==n and if we provide n then instead of kxk grid (k+1)x(k+1) grid will be generated.

    #resulting a maximum of '(2k+1)' rectangles space being unoptimised and a minimum of 'ONE' rectangle space being unoptimised.

    Ex: for n=9 we have k=3 i.e., 3**2==9 then 4x4 grid will be generated. resulting a maximum of 7(max 2k+1) rectangles space being unoptimised
    i.e., (2*3+1).
    Ex: for n=10 we have k=3 i.e., 3**2==9 then 4x4 grid will be generated. resulting a maximum of 6 rectangles space being unoptimised
    i.e., ((2*3+1)-1).
    Ex: for n=11 we have k=3 i.e., 3**2==9 then 4x4 grid will be generated. resulting a maximum of 5 rectangles space being unoptimised
    i.e., ((2*3+1)-2).
    Ex: for n=12 we have k=3 i.e., 3**2==9 then 4x4 grid will be generated. resulting a maximum of 4 rectangles space being unoptimised
    i.e., ((2*3+1)-3).
    Ex: for n=13 we have k=3 i.e., 3**2==9 then 4x4 grid will be generated. resulting a maximum of 3 rectangles space being unoptimised
    i.e., ((2*3+1)-4).
    Ex: for n=14 we have k=3 i.e., 3**2==9 then 4x4 grid will be generated. resulting a maximum of 2 rectangles space being unoptimised
    i.e., ((2*3+1)-5).
    Ex: for n=15 we have k=3 i.e., 3**2==9 then 4x4 grid will be generated. resulting a maximum of 1(min 1) rectangles space being unoptimised
    i.e., ((2*3+1)-6).
    Ex: for n=16 we have k=4 i.e., 4**2==16 then 5x5 grid will be generated. resulting a maximum of 9(max 2k+1) rectangles space being unoptimised
    i.e., (2*4+1).

    #In the previous one we got maximum of 2k and minimum of 1 rectangle space being unoptimised.
    #But in this below code
                     we got a maximum of (2k+1) and minimum of 1 rectangle space being unoptimised.

        Which is completely acceptable where the difference between the max unoptimised rectangles is ONE.
